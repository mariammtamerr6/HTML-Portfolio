<h1>My Top Shows</h1>
<h2>Mariam's Ultimate Watch List</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. The Walking Dead</h3>
<p>Seriously the best show out there; full of action, thriller, drama, good actors. You name it, this show has it. Will watch it
    over and over again without ever getting bored.
</p>

<h3>2. One Piece</h3>
<p>Best. Anime. Ever.
</p>

<h3>3. Spiderman Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>I'm not much of a movies person, but the animation of this film is just perfect. I get so inspired to draw and 
    animate and be creative just from seeing snippets of this masterpiece.
</p>

<h3>4. Crash Landing On You</h3>
<p>The cutest, funniest, warmest, best k-drama out there. I love it so much. Top actors, top quality, top everything.</p>

<h5>P.S. there are not ranked; I chose my ultimate favorite series, my ultimate favorite anime, my ultimate favorite movie, and my
    ultimate favorite k-drama. They are all ranked equally, though.
